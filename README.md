# Invoice(Offerte)
Bootsrap & Angularjs PDF invoice creater

This project is still in development.

It's an invoice creater with simpele bootstrap forms. 
Angularjs will read the input information and will paste it into a nice a4 like page,
which u can print or save as pdf.

This part is done but the project owner is coming up with new ideas,
so the project will be expanding.

Future feature's:
-save invoice's to a SQL database
-read those invoice into a new view(in alpha)
-select an invoice and it will open an editable invoice with all the information/data from the old invoice, for re-printing


I am an intern at MintyMedia, a small webdevelopment company.
This is the project I am currently working on, this is also the end project for school.
